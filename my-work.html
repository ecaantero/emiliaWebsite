                            Our team explored the connection between visual art and music by developing a neural network to predict an album’s genre based solely on its cover art. Using a dataset of 20,000 album covers across 20 genres, we applied transfer learning with DenseNet121 to classify covers into genres like rock, hip-hop, jazz, and metal.
